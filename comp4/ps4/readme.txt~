 *  DNA Sequence Alignment
 **********************************************************************/

Name: Angel Calcano

Hours to complete assignment (optional):
about 15 hours 


/**********************************************************************
 *  Explain what you did to find the alignment itself.
 **********************************************************************/
Checked to see if the current position is out of bounds from the matrix.If its
not check to see if the letters mach, if they do match print the cost, 
then increment the values of i and j to the next position. After the increment I 
call the alignment again to check if they match, have a miss match, or if there is a gap. 


/**********************************************************************
 * Does your code work correctly with the endgaps7.txt test file? 
 * 
 * This example should require you to insert a gap at the beginning
 * of the Y string and the end of the X string.
 **********************************************************************/
Input:

atattat
tattata

Expected output:
should have an edit distance of 0 

What happened: My code doesn't work properly I got an editdistance of 4
for what ever reason it thinks there are 2 gaps. My output is the following

Edit distance 4
a-2
tt0
aa0
tt0
tt0
aa0
tt0
-2
